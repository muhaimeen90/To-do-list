# To-do-list
A small JAVA project of To-do list using OOP principles.

Here is a brief rundown of the whole project and how the project is specifically made for my academic purposese: 
>implementing OOP principles
> Following SOLID principle
S- every class or method has a single responsiblity
O- every class can easily be extendable and doesnt need modifications
L- though subclasses arent used, it can easily be used for if we divide tasks into other subclasses
I- A clearly defined interface is not used but no class has unnecessary methods
D- class follows low cohesion and tight coupling( doesnt have any hardcoded dependency)

> every class is encapsulated and restricted to access modifiers
> Using exception handling while accessing file
> Using collections
> Eliminating Code Smells as much as I can(there's only one long main method and no other method exceeds 10 lines of code)

Topics that were taught in class used in this project:
1. SOLID principle
2. Advanced OOP
3. Exception Handling
4. File
5. Collections
6. Code smells

Topics that were not taught but used in this project:
1. Local date(a class which makes it easier to manipulate dates)
2. Streams(class which is used to filter out tasks)
